Just stumbled out of Plankton: The Movie and, wow, what a weird trip that was. Popcorn all over my jeans, and my back's killing me from those theater chairs that feel like they're made out of old car parts. But the  , man, it’s like someone dropped a microscope into a fish tank and decided to 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 a saga.

Okay, so first—bright colors, brighter than your phone screen on max in a dark room. Those plankton, flitting and wiggling like they’re at some underwater rave. There’s a scene, I think, where a plankton named Bob—or was it Blob?—goes on this existential journey about his role in the ocean. Trippy, like that time I tried to read Nietzsche backwards. The dialogue was a mix of scientific mumbo-jumbo and poetry. Kind of like if Carl Sagan had a fever dream after a sushi night.

> The sound. Oh, the sound! Booming like thunder or maybe just the result of kids kicking the back of my seat. Can't tell where the  's rumbles end and real life begins. Is this what madness feels like? Or just too much cola? Someone behind me was snoring—no wait, that was during the big action scene where the plankton form a GIANT PLANKTON VOLTRON to fight some kraken shadow or something. My mind's making spaghetti of memories right now.

The thing is, my friend was asking last week, Can you 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   for me? Right after wanting to know if it's worth it to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   in theaters. Written back then? Nah, no way to capture this chaos on a laptop. Just sheer lunacy you can't 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 at 1080𝘱.

Sometimes, it's like the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 was trying to bathe me in philosophy, but then someone threw a tomato—a metaphorical one—right on the screen. Did that plot twist actually twist, or did it flop like a soggy tortilla? Was there even a plot? Maybe it was more of an ocean flow. Nah, I must be dreaming. Couldn’t keep track if the   was in Spanish or my brain just translated Planktonese. 

So anyway, last thing, Dave the Plankton’s epic dialogue... Why does it remind me of that time when Margaret lost her guinea pig? Both feel confusingly life-altering. Ah, whatever, it so reminds me of... what was that thing... oh, never mind.
